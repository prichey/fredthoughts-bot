# fredthoughts-bot

A simple Slackbot to automate posting to [@FromFredsMouth](https://twitter.com/FromFredsMouth).

Will tweet a Fred thought if it gets 3 or more yays (üëç) and no nays (üëé).

### Installation

Add a `.env` file at the root with the following credentials:

```
SLACKBOT_TOKEN=''
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=''
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=''
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=''
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=''
```

For anyone at 40D, these can be found in LastPass under `Fredthoughts Slackbot Credentials`.
